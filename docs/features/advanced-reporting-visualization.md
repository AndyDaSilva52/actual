# Advanced Reporting and Visualization Feature for Actual Budget

This document outlines the proposed "Advanced Reporting and Visualization" feature for Actual Budget, designed to provide users with deeper insights into their financial data.

## 1. Customizable Dashboards

The core of this feature would be highly customizable dashboards, allowing users to create personalized views of their financial landscape.

*   **Multiple Dashboards:**
    *   Users can create and save multiple distinct dashboards (e.g., "Financial Overview," "Investment Hub," "Debt Management," "Monthly Spending Review").
    *   Each dashboard can be named and configured independently.
    *   Easy switching between dashboards.
*   **Available Widgets:**
    A library of widgets would be available to add to dashboards. Examples include:
    *   **Net Worth Over Time:** Line chart showing net worth progression.
    *   **Spending by Category:** Pie chart, bar chart, or treemap showing spending distribution for a selected period.
    *   **Income vs. Expense:** Bar or line chart comparing total income and expenses over selected periods.
    *   **Budget Variance:** Table or bar chart showing actual spending vs. budgeted amounts for categories, highlighting over/under spending.
    *   **Upcoming Bills & Subscriptions:** List or calendar view of recurring transactions and their due dates.
    *   **Investment Performance Summary:** (Leveraging Investment Tracking feature) Key metrics like total portfolio value, unrealized/realized gains, asset allocation pie chart.
    *   **Debt Payoff Progress:** (Leveraging Debt Paydown Planner) Summary of total debt, progress towards debt freedom, current target debt payment.
    *   **Account Balances:** List of selected account balances.
    *   **Savings Goals Progress:** Progress bars for active savings goals.
    *   **Recent Transactions:** A feed of the latest transactions.
    *   **Cash Flow Calendar:** A calendar view highlighting days with significant income or expenses.
    *   **Custom Report Widget:** Embed a saved custom report directly onto a dashboard.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**
    *   Users can easily add, remove, and rearrange widgets on a dashboard using a drag-and-drop interface.
    *   Widgets should be resizable to fit different layouts.
*   **Saving Dashboard Layouts:**
    *   Each dashboard's widget selection, arrangement, and individual widget configurations (e.g., time period for a spending chart) would be saved.
    *   Option to set a default dashboard to load upon opening Actual Budget.

## 2. New Chart Types & Enhancements

To provide richer insights, the system would introduce new chart types and improve existing ones.

*   **New Chart Types:**
    *   **Sankey Diagrams:** For visualizing cash flow, showing how income from various sources is allocated to different expense categories, savings, and debt payments.
    *   **Treemaps:** For displaying hierarchical data, like budget allocations where parent categories are large rectangles and sub-categories are smaller rectangles within them, sized by amount. Useful for visualizing spending distribution at a glance.
    *   **Heatmaps:** For visualizing spending patterns, e.g., spending by day of the week and category, or spending intensity across a calendar month.
    *   **Scatter Plots:** To identify relationships between two variables, e.g., spending amount vs. time of day, or income vs. savings rate.
    *   **Waterfall Charts:** To show the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values (e.g., starting income, add/subtract various expense categories to arrive at net savings).
*   **Interactive Elements in Charts:**
    *   **Drill-Down:** Clicking on a segment of a chart (e.g., a category in a spending pie chart) would dynamically update the chart or a linked table to show sub-category details or individual transactions within that category.
    *   **Hover-Over for Details:** Mousing over chart elements would display tooltips with precise values, dates, or category names.
    *   **Toggle Series:** Ability to show/hide different data series on a chart (e.g., comparing income from different sources on a line chart).
    *   **Zoom and Pan:** For time-series charts, allow users to zoom into specific periods or pan across the timeline.
*   **Comparison Capabilities:**
    *   **Time Period Comparison:** Easily compare data (e.g., spending, income) across different periods (e.g., this month vs. last month, this year vs. last year, custom ranges). This could be a side-by-side chart or an overlay on the same chart.
    *   **Category Comparison:** Compare spending in one category versus another over time.
    *   **Budget vs. Actual Over Time:** Visualize how well the user sticks to their budget across multiple months, not just the current one.

## 3. Advanced Data Analysis & Filtering

Empowering users to slice and dice their data for deeper understanding.

*   **Trend Analysis:**
    *   **Income/Expense Trends:** Analyze trends in total income, total expenses, or specific categories over months or years. Show growth rates or percentage changes.
    *   **Savings Rate Trend:** Track how the user's savings rate (percentage of income saved) changes over time.
    *   **Year-Over-Year (YoY) and Month-Over-Month (MoM) Comparisons:** Dedicated views or calculations for these common financial analysis metrics.
*   **Granular Filtering Options for Reports:**
    *   **By Payee:** Filter transactions and reports based on specific payees.
    *   **By Tags/Labels:** Allow users to create custom tags (e.g., #vacation2024, #homerepair) and filter reports based on these.
    *   **By Account:** Filter reports to include/exclude specific accounts or account types (e.g., only credit card spending, only investment account activity).
    *   **Custom Date Ranges:** More flexibility than just "this month" or "last year"; allow selection of arbitrary start and end dates.
    *   **Exclude Transfers:** Option to easily exclude internal account transfers from spending/income reports to avoid double-counting.
    *   **Transaction Amount Range:** Filter by transactions greater than, less than, or between certain amounts.
    *   **Combined Filters:** Allow multiple filters to be applied simultaneously (e.g., spending in "Groceries" category, from "Checking Account," for "last 3 months").
*   **Custom Report Builder:**
    *   A dedicated interface where users can build reports from scratch.
    *   **Select Data Points:** Choose the specific fields/columns they want in the report (e.g., Date, Payee, Category, Amount, Account, Notes, Tags).
    *   **Apply Filters:** Use the advanced filtering options described above.
    *   **Group By:** Ability to group data by category, payee, month, year, etc.
    *   **Summarize By:** Calculate sums, averages, counts for grouped data.
    *   **Choose Visualization:** Select how the custom report data should be displayed (table, specific chart type).
    *   **Save Custom Reports:** Users can save their custom report configurations for quick access later or for embedding in dashboards.

## 4. Exporting & Sharing

Facilitating the use of financial data outside of Actual Budget.

*   **Export Options:**
    *   **PDF:** For printable, well-formatted reports and dashboards.
    *   **CSV:** For exporting raw data from tables or report results for use in spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) or other analysis tools.
    *   **PNG/JPEG:** For exporting individual charts or entire dashboard views as images.
    *   Configuration options for exports (e.g., date range, specific accounts/categories).
*   **Secure Sharing (Potential Future Enhancement):**
    *   A mechanism to generate a secure, read-only link to a specific report or dashboard.
    *   User could set an expiration date for the link.
    *   Useful for sharing financial summaries with a financial advisor, accountant, or family member without granting full access to Actual Budget. Authentication for the viewer might be required.

## 5. Integration with Existing and Proposed Features

The Advanced Reporting and Visualization feature would be deeply integrated with all aspects of Actual Budget:

*   **Budget:**
    *   All budget data (categories, budgeted amounts, actual spending, income) would be foundational inputs for reports and visualizations.
    *   Budget variance widgets and reports would directly use this data.
*   **Accounts:**
    *   Transaction data from all accounts (checking, savings, credit cards, cash) would be the primary source for spending, income, and cash flow analysis.
    *   Account balances and trends would be available for dashboard widgets.
*   **Investment Tracking (Proposed Feature):**
    *   Data from the investment module (portfolio value, asset allocation, gains/losses, dividend income) would feed into dedicated investment dashboard widgets and reports.
    *   Investment performance could be correlated with overall net worth trends.
*   **Debt Paydown Planner (Proposed Feature):**
    *   Data from the debt planner (total debt, individual debt balances, payoff progress, interest paid) would be available for debt-specific dashboard widgets and reports.
    *   Progress on debt reduction can be visually tracked alongside other financial goals.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Progress towards savings goals can be visualized and incorporated into dashboards.
*   **Tags/Notes:**
    *   Leverage tags and notes associated with transactions for more refined filtering and reporting.

By providing these advanced reporting and visualization capabilities, Actual Budget can empower users to not just track their finances, but to truly understand their financial behavior, identify trends, and make more informed decisions.
